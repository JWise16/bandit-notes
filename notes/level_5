Still not done with this level yet...


So far - I have a search for all files non-executable

```
$ find ! -executable
```


Here's another command for finding non-executable + readable
```
$ find . -readable \! -executable
```
((These are the same))



Here's a command for finding sizes of all files -
```
$ ls -a -R --size -S -h
```

Another command for finding sizes of all files - 
```
du -a -all -h
```


Im guessing I also need to filter by size ? (1033 bytes)


for commands we have...
```
ls - 

cd

cat

file

du

find
```



--DONE--

Solution = locate file with size 1033 bytes

```
find . -size 1033c
```

Was also useful to filter by file permissions - but ended up with > 60 results - would need to filter by size anyway
