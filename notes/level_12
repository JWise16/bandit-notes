[[LEVEL 12]]

For this level - we need to make a tempdir

```
$ mktemp -d
```

for this round, the tmpdir is... `/tmp/tmp.ocwSxHOxIt`


Next - let's copy our file over to the new tmpdir

```
$ cp data.txt /tmp/tmp.ocwSxHOIt/
```

and confirm the data has moved to the new spot

```
$ ls /tmp/tmp.ocwSxHOxIt/
```

It get's a bit repetitive - so here's a summary of the useful commands

First - convert the hexdump back into a file
```
$ xxd -r /tmp/tmp.ocwSxHOxIt/data.txt
```

A compressed file must be uncompressed by the same set of compression tools - therefore - we'll use `$ file fileName` to find out what kind of compressed file we are working with & then use the correct uncompression tool !
